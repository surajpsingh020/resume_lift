# Startup Scripts - No More Port Conflicts! ðŸš€

## Problem Solved
These scripts automatically kill any processes using ports 5001 (Backend) and 5173 (Frontend) before starting the servers, eliminating port conflict issues forever.

## Quick Start (Easiest Method)

### Windows - Just Double Click!
1. Navigate to the project root folder
2. Double-click `start-all.bat` 
3. Done! âœ“

Or from command prompt/PowerShell:
```cmd
start-all.bat
```

This will:
- Clean up both ports (5001 and 5173)
- Start Backend in a new window
- Start Frontend in a new window
- Show you the URLs for both services

## Alternative Methods

### Option 1: PowerShell Script
Run this from the project root directory:
```powershell
.\start-all.ps1
```

### Option 2: Start Backend Only
```powershell
cd Backend
.\start.ps1
```
Or using npm:
```powershell
cd Backend
npm run dev:clean
```

### Option 3: Start Frontend Only
```powershell
cd Frontend
.\start.ps1
```
Or using npm:
```powershell
cd Frontend
npm run dev:clean
```

### Option 4: Original Method (May Have Port Conflicts)
```powershell
# Backend
cd Backend
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

## What Each Script Does

### `start-all.ps1` (Root Directory)
- Checks and kills processes on ports 5001 and 5173
- Opens two new PowerShell windows
- Starts Backend in one window
- Starts Frontend in another window
- Displays success message with URLs

### `Backend/start.ps1`
- Checks and kills any process using port 5001
- Starts the Backend server with nodemon
- MongoDB connection and Express server on http://localhost:5001

### `Frontend/start.ps1`
- Checks and kills any process using port 5173
- Starts the Frontend Vite dev server
- React app on http://localhost:5173

## PowerShell Execution Policy

If you get an execution policy error, run this once:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## How It Works

Each script uses PowerShell's `Get-NetTCPConnection` to find processes listening on the required ports, then stops them before starting the server. This ensures a clean start every time.

## Service URLs

After running the scripts, access your application at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5001
- **MongoDB**: Connected to your MongoDB Atlas cluster

## Troubleshooting

### Script won't run
- Make sure you're in PowerShell (not CMD)
- Set execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

### Port still in use
- Run `start-all.ps1` again (it will force-kill the processes)
- Or manually kill all node processes: `Stop-Process -Name node -Force`

### Backend crashes
- Check MongoDB connection in `.env` file
- Verify all dependencies: `cd Backend && npm install`

### Frontend crashes
- Verify all dependencies: `cd Frontend && npm install`
- Check if port 5173 is available

## Benefits

âœ… No more "EADDRINUSE" errors
âœ… One command to start everything
âœ… Automatic cleanup of stale processes
âœ… Separate windows for easy monitoring
âœ… Colored output for better visibility
âœ… Works every time!

## Notes

- The scripts will automatically request admin privileges if needed
- Each server runs in its own PowerShell window
- You can close the startup script window after servers start
- To stop servers, just close their PowerShell windows or press Ctrl+C
